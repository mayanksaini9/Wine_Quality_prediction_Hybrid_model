# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction  

## 📌 Overview  
This project aims to predict the quality of wine based on its physicochemical properties using **Machine Learning** techniques. The dataset used in this project contains red and white wine samples with features such as acidity, sugar levels, pH, and alcohol content.  

## 🗂 Dataset  
The dataset is sourced from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**, containing various physicochemical attributes of wine samples along with their quality ratings (scaled from 0 to 10).  

## 🚀 Project Workflow  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values (if any)  
   - Data normalization & standardization  
   - Feature selection  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualizing correlations between features and wine quality  
   - Understanding key factors influencing wine quality  

3. **Model Selection & Training**  
   - Trained multiple models including:  
     - Random Forest  
     - Gradient Boosting Classifier 
     - SVC  
   - Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning & Optimization**  
   - Used **GridSearchCV** & **RandomizedSearchCV** for improving model performance  

5. **Final Model & Predictions**  
   - Selected the best-performing model  
   - Provided predictions for new wine samples  

## 📊 Results    
- **Accuracy Achieved:** *[84.99]*  

## 🛠 Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## 💡 Key Insights  
- Higher alcohol content and balanced acidity significantly impact wine quality.  
- Random Forest outperformed other models in terms of accuracy and robustness.
